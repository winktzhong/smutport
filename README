smutport
--------

This is a simple SMTP server which simply saves the incoming messages in
a directory structure of mailboxes:

    mailboxes directory:
        user1:
            <someid>.mail
            <someid>.mail
            ...
        user2:
            <someid>.mail
            ...

Some other program or web application can parse the .mail files to read
the mails.

To build smutport you also need lil. Smutport uses lil for configuration.
